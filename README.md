## Implementation Approaches
This component is provided in two formats:

- Single-file version (Stepper.tsx) – A self-contained file with all logic, styles, and state included. This is ideal for quick copying and easy integration.
- Structured version – The component is broken into smaller parts, including reusable subcomponents and a custom hook for managing step logic. This approach demonstrates best practices for maintainability and scalability.

Both versions are available in the repository for different use cases.
